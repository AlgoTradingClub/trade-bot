Here we could make a cli interface file that works similar to 'manage.py' from django. Meaning, that since this is in the top level directory, it can run any function, unittest, and would make a centralized point of entry for any of the programs.

Does anyone have objection for this?

This file could use the package pyCLI to automate the command line interface making process.
maybe using 'click' or 'fire'. They seem a bit more friendly than 'argparse'
