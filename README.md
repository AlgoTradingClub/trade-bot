# Table of contents
1. cli.py: This is the start of the system that initializes the rest of the functionality of the project
2. helpers:
   	- Scaffolding Code. This is where we put 'dirty code', code that does not contain core business rules but that's nonetheless needed for the project.
	- It's important to have a separate for this kind of code because if you place it together with actual business logic code, it will be increasingly hard to understand the business logic because there's so much other stuff mixed in.
3. models:
   	- This is where the core of your business logic goes. Here you write classes, modules and components that make up the domain you are writing code for.
4. tests:
   	- Tests are documentation and Tests allow you to update and modify your project
5. utils
   	- Here is where you should put code that you need for your application, but that is general enough that it could be used somewhere else.
	- Using a separate folder for these helps you remember to write this code in a way that is totally decoupled from the rest of your application.
6. docs: 
	- Documentation, requirements, and todo lists.
