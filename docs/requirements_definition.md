Preformance based requirements that focus on how the different parts of the system interact as well as with external systems (APIs).

### Other
Anything else I haven't thought of (probably a lot).

## Specifications
These are in depth break downs of how to accomplish the requirements stated above. This should as detailed down to the indvidual functions that will be used and how individual functions will be used by other requirements.

## Use Cases
These are mentioned in this paper, but they are usually drawings/ schematics of how different systems or agents (the trader) will interact with with each other. Use cases are visual diagrams, which can include UML diagrams, etc to convey different interactions of the system.
