# USU Algo Club : Trading Bot 2021

Agile Development club project. Agile methodology was chosen because it stresses adaptability over predictablility, testing alongside code development, and just enough documentation.
- Highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
- It welcomes changing requirements, even late in development.
- Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shortest timescale.
- Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment, and the support they need, and trust them to get the job done.
- Working software is the primary measure of progress.
- Simplicity the art of maximizing the amount of work not done is essential.
- The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.

## Summary
The goal of the USU AlgoTrading Club is to empower students to become educated about the stock market, investments, and
the technology that they have at their disposal to improve their financial situation. Ever since the rise of companies likes RobinHood and Alpaca, 
the stock market has become much more available to the common trader. They allow for zero commision trading which has historically costed
for each stock you wanted to trade. E*trade disrupted the industry when it offered trades for only $15. Now every company
has started to offer $0 trading. The possibility to create a semi-autonomous or autonomous trading bot not unlike what large 
trading firms use is now reality. Here as computer scientist at USU, we aim to capitalize on the skills we have and in the 
age in which we live.

## Concept of Operation (ConOp)
The purpose of this project is to create a trading bot that will trade on a paper or live Alpaca account using various 
algorithms. The bot will make a profit on a daily trading, will be interfaced through a CLI, and will be simple to use.

## Requirements
The various requirements that the bot must achieve are broken up into performance, user, system, other.
The requirements will use the language as follows:
- `must`. Things that are required. i.e. 'The bot must use Alpaca as a broker'
- `should`. Things that will probably be there. i.e. 'The bot should make a profit every month'
- `could`. Things that might be there with enough time. i.e. 'The bot could use a neural network as one of its deciding algorithms'
- `wont`. Things that won't be there. i.e. 'The bot won't use a sql database to maintain simplicity and readability'


### Performance

### User Requirements
Requirements relating to the user and how they interact with the system. This is what the system has to do, but not necessarily how to accomplish it.

### System Requirements
Preformance based requirements that focus on how the different parts of the system interact as well as with external systems (APIs).

### Other
Anything else I haven't thought of (probably a lot).

## Specifications
These are in depth break downs of how to accomplish the requirements stated above. This should as detailed down to the indvidual functions that will be used and how individual functions will be used by other requirements.

## Use Cases
These are mentioned in this paper, but they are usually drawings/ schematics of how different systems or agents (the trader) will interact with with each other. Use cases are visual diagrams, which can include UML diagrams, etc to convey different interactions of the system.
